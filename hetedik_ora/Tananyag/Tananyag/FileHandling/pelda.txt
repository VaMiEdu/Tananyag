In this tutorial, you create a .NET Core console app that performs data access against a SQLite database using Entity Framework Core.
You can follow the tutorial by using Visual Studio on Windows, or by using the .NET Core CLI on Windows, macOS, or Linux.
To install EF Core, you install the package for the EF Core database provider(s) you want to target. This tutorial uses SQLite because it runs on all platforms that .NET Core supports. For a list of available providers, see Database Providers.
